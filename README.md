# WORD-FINDER
*Note that this code is a modified version of [WORDLE SOLVER](https://github.com/KnifeEater/Wordle-solver) that I made.*  
This code is like a big updated version of that code.  
  
  
  **New features:**  
  **BONUS search mode, "perfect search" (based on advenced mode, just a little slover)**
  **WORD LENGTH customization! (now you can search for any word)**  
  **Custom word add and search action!**  
  **Rank show buttom (now you can see the rank of the word if you are interested)**  
  That's it for now!  
  
    
    
    **Note that when finding a 10+ char length word, be sure to indicate it with letters in place and _'s.**  
      
      
      
      **Sorce:**
