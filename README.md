# WORD-FINDER
*Note that this code is a modified version of [WORDLE SOLVER](https://github.com/KnifeEater/Wordle-solver) that I made.*  
This code is like a big updated version of that code.  
  
  
  **New features:**  
  **BONUS search mode, "perfect search" (based on advenced mode, just a little slover)**  
  **WORD LENGTH customization! (now you can search for any word)**  
  **Custom word add and search action!**  
  **Rank show buttom (now you can see the rank of the word if you are interested)**  
  **Reset search button (if you skipped something with next button, you can now go back with this button)**  
  *Keep in mind that you can also input your library of choice and letters of your alphabet in letters_rank file*
  *This code can work on other languages (but not all, due to symbols comlications)*
  
    
    
**Note that when finding a 10+ char length word, be sure to indicate it with letters in place and _'s.**  
      
      
      
**SOURCES:**
Finally, without a word libary, this code wouldn't be here.
