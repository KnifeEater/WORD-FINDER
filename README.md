# WORD-FINDER
*Note that this code is a modified version of [WORDLE SOLVER](https://github.com/KnifeEater/Wordle-solver) that I made.*  
This code is like a big updated version of that code.  
  
  
  **New features:**  
  **BONUS search mode, "perfect search" (based on advenced mode, just a little slover)**  
  **WORD LENGTH customization! (now you can search for any word)**  
  **Custom word add and search action!**  
  **Rank show buttom (now you can see the rank of the word if you are interested)**  
  **Reset search button (if you skipped something with next button, you can now go back with this button)**  
  *Keep in mind that you can also input your library of choice and letters of your alphabet in letters_rank file*  
  *This code can work on other languages (but not all, due to symbols comlications)*  
  ## NEW UPDATE 1.2  
  You can now inport your library of choice. Yes, you heard it right! It is now fully functional!  
  *Only restriction is that it doesn't accept characters in alphabet made out of two letters or more. Keep that in mind...*  
  So, how do you do it? *Easy.*  
  Add dictionary into txt file named [words_alpha](https://github.com/KnifeEater/WORD-FINDER/blob/main/WORD%20FINDER/bin/Debug/words_alpha.txt) (or just put a txt file named as that)  
  Second, add **ALL** your letters of alphabet in letters_rank file. Make sure that every letter is in its own line (uppercase or lowercase, doesn't matter)  
  And lastly, third, run the program and acess developer mode (input a,d,m,i,n in five masked boxes and "admin" in "forbidden letters textbox" and press reset)  
  Press the "letter rank" button and then "word rank" button. This **NEEDS** to be in order.  
  **All done. You can now enjoy your modded word finder!**
  
  
    
### Notes:  
**When finding a 10+ char length word, be sure to indicate it with letters in place and _'s.**  
      
      
      
**SOURCES:**
Finally, without a word libary, this code wouldn't be here.
